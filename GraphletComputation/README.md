The folder GraphletComputation/ shows how to do microbial network comparisons for networks of different sizes. It is based on 
the Graphlet Correlation Distance (GCD), as introduced in 
* [3] Yaveroglu et al., [Revealing the Hidden Language of Complex Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04547), 
Scientific Reports vol 4:4547 (2014)

For computation of the graphlets (i.e., small induced subgraphs), the orca package is used, as introduced in
* [4] Hocevar & Demsar, [A combinatorial approach to graphlet counting]
(https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/30/4/559/205331), Bioinformatics vol 30:4,559--565 (2014)
The github CRAN read-only mirror for the orca package can be found [here.](https://github.com/cran/orca)
