# Microbial Network Analysis (MNA) in MATLAB


This project comprises a collection of functions and scripts for (microbial) network analysis. This repository is constantly expanded and tested. Many of the scripts have been used in a number of publications, see, e.g., in 
* [1] Ruiz et al., [A single early-in-life macrolide course has lasting effects on murine microbial network topology and immunity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00531-6), Nature Communications vol 8:518 (2017)
